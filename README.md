# Mini Project9: Cloud-Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation

## Overview
In this mini project, we will use a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook environment, specifically Google Colab, to perform data manipulation on a cereal dataset. Leveraging the power of cloud computing, we can effortlessly handle, transform, and analyze data without the need for local dependencies.

Dataset used: [80 Cereals](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals)

## Steps
1. Set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook environment (Google Colab).
2. Load the dataset, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) including summary statistics and data visualization, and perform data filtering and sorting within the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Link the Google Colab environment to a GitHub repository.
4. Create a Makefile to automate the setup and execution processes.
5. Validate the format and test for any errors.
